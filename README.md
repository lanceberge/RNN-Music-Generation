# Generate Music

- WIP project to use a encoder-decoder Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM to generate music using midi data
- Data was scraped from [midiworld.com](midiworld.com) using code from: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52124737/why-cant-i-download-a-midi-file-with-python-requests)
- The midi files were converted to numpy arrays using code from: [link](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/convert-midi-file-to-numpy-array-in-python-7d00531890c)
- The model structure was guided by: [link](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/1%20-%20Sequence%20to%20Sequence%20Learning%20with%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)
